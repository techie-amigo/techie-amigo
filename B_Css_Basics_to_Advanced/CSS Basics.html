	<li>The purpose of this Trail is to ensure that web pages have some basic readable layout,even when no custom css have been applied.</li>

	<h2>How CSS Works?</h2><hr>
	<li><b>Linking CSS to HTML ::</b> CSS must be connected to the HTML document.</li>
	<li>This can be done by three ways.</li><br>
	<li><b>CSS Selectors ::</b> CSS styles are applied to HTML element through what is called selectors, meaning we are going to select the pieces of HTML that we want to style.</li><br>
	<li><b>CSS declaration ::</b> This declaration is made up of a property and a value separated by a colon and enclosed in a declaration.</li>
	<li>The property specifies what style or characteristics you want to change.</li><br>
	<li><b>The cascade ::</b> Cascade is one of the most important aspects of CSS.</li>
	<li>It means that when multiple styles are applied to the same element, the browser follows certain rules.To determine which style takes precedence.</li><br>
	<li><b>Inheritance ::</b> IN CSS some styles like color, font, size, family and others are inherited by child elements from their parent element , while other properties like padding margin border are not.</li>
	<li>This feature of CSS can be used to write more efficient code and maintain consistancy.</li><br>
	<li><b>Rendering ::</b> This is where we are going to see the actual effect of the CSS being appied to the element.</li>
	<li>Once the breser has determined the appropriate styles for each element through cascading and inheritance, then it applies those styles and renders the web page for viewing.</li>

	<h2>How Browser Renders CSS?</h2><hr>
	<li><b>Fetching Resources ::</b> Before a browser can display the actual application or website, it needs to download the resources for the server</li>
	<li>These resources can be of Javascript, CSS, HTML and any other files. so the process begins when the browser fetches the HTML file.</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Parsing HTML :: </b>The browser parses the HTML document into a document object modelwhich represents" DOM "</li>
	<li>Which is a tree like Structure representing all the elements on the page.</li><br>
	<li><b>Parsing CSS :: </b>During the parsing of a HTML and CSS, the passing of CSS occurs simultaneously.</li>
	<li>The browser parses any linked or embedded CSS into a CSS object model called CSS SOM or CSS ORM.</li>
	<li>Which is a representation of all the styles that will be applied to the DOM.</li><br>
	<li><b>Constructing Render Tree :: </b> The browser combines the Dom and CSS samples into render tree.</li>
	<li>this render tree contains information about each visible DOM element along with CSS properties that should be applied to the HTML element</li><br>
	<li><b>Layout :: </b>Once the render tree is built, then the browser calculates the layout, determine the exact position and size of each element on the screen.</li>
	<li>The result of this process is a box model, which we will talk about it as we move on.It includes details like dimensions,padding,border and margin.</li><br>
	<li><b>Painting :: </b>The browser paint each node in the render tree to the screen following the order of the tree.</li>
	<li>Painting involves applying the exact styles defined in the CSS.</li>
	<li> Examples colors, gradients, images, borders, shadows, and so much more</li>
