		<h1>Html Comments</h1>

		<p>Comment is nothing but a index or information which we are written in the code.<br/>For example if we are not using comments after 5 years if you came through the code you cant understand the code.<br/>But if you are using comments it would be very helpful to understand the code clearly.</p>

		<h2>Html comment types</h2>
		<p>single line comments.</p>
		<p>multiple line comments.</p>

		<!---This is  single line comment and we cant see this text in your website --->

		<!---This is multi line comment this is for
