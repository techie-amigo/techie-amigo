	<h1>HTML Rules</h1>
	<li>The first rule is that use lowercase letters for all tasks and attributes.</li>
	<li>Html is not case sensitive,meaning that if you use uppercase or lowercase,a Html will be rendered.</li>
	<li>But it is a good practice to use lowercase letters for all tags and attributes to maintain consistency.</li>
	<li>It is easy to understand the code.</li>
	<li>All tags must be in proper nesting,Meaning that if a task is open,It might be closed in the correct order.</li>
	<li>It's also helps to maintain consitency to make our code easier to read and maintain and to understand.</li>
